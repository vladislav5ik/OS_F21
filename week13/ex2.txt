1.Recovery
This method check if large number of processes were blocked and CPU load is low. When deadblock happens, this algorithm finds deadlock processes and kill them.

This method not loading CPU with many checks, and may be effective if deadlocks happens not often.

2.Prevention

This method used with recovery method. It uses more checks to prevent deadlocks, so this method is more effective.
But, method can significantly load CPU because of preventions deadlock's conditions.

3.Avoidance

This method doesn't have any prevention algorithm, so it not load CPU. But you can use this method only if you 100% trust of deadblock can not occure on your computer. Also, this method requaries smart scheduler.
